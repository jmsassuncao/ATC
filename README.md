# auto_terrain_classification
Experimental automatic terrain classification plugin for Qgis, intended for land use and land cover applications.

The following experimental plugin was created in the sequence of a master thesis focused on the creation of an automatic land use and land cover classifier. The plugin employs the best performing machine learning algorithm (neural networks) among the tested approaches (Support vector machines, Random Forest, Neural networks), to predict 9 commonly used major classes (Artificialized, Agricultural, Pasture, Agroforestry, Forests, Bushes, Uncultured, Wetlands, Water Bodies) in a multi-temporal per-pixel approach.
